# D3.JS Links in Force Directed Graphs
This is a simple `force directed graph` demonstrating the concept of building the `links` in such graphs

The graph is built with `D3.JS` and `SVGs`

It can also be found on [Codepen](https://codepen.io/bmuthoga/pen/ExapdXO), and on [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/d3-links-in-force-directed-graphs-s6i77)

Below is a preview of how it looks like:
